'A high school counselor wants to categorize students according to 2 variables: gender (male or female) and grade level (F, S, H, Se). There
are 8 (4 x 2) possible outcomes can students be assigned.

An Economics professor kept a record of grades earned by college students in his class, as shown below.

          A	  B	  C	  D	  F
Freshman	5	  10	9	  10	6
Sophomore	8	  10	9	  7	  4
Junior	  11	5 	4	  4	  2
Senior	  9	  9	  4	  2 	0

0.258 (33/128) of students in the class received a grade of A, 0.391 of students are upperclassmen, the probability that a freshman 
received a failing grade of F is 0.15 (6/40), the probability that a randomly selected student from the class would be a sophomore 
that received a grade of B is 0.078125 (10/128), the proportion of juniors passed the course with a grade of D or better is 0.92, or 
(24/26), the probability that a randomly selected student from this class would be a senior is 0.1875 (24/128), if a student received a D 
in the class, the probability that the student was a senior is 0.086956522 (2/23), the probability that a randomly selected student is a 
senior changes if we know that the student received a grade of D in the course (19% to 9%)
