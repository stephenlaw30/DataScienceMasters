'A professor asked her students to report how much time they spent completing a take-home exam. The minimum time 
reported was half an hour, and the maximum was six and a half hours. She compiled the data into a relative frequency 
table, shown below. Note that one value is missing.

Time Spent on Exam	                      Relative Frequency
Less than 1 hour	                        20%
At least 1 hour, but less than 2 hours	  20%
At least 2 hours, but less than 3 hours	      <-- would be 100-20-20-15-15-10-5 = 15
At least 3 hours, but less than 4 hours	  15%
At least 4 hours, but less than 5 hours	  15%
At least 5 hours, but less than 6 hours	  10%
At least 6 hours, but less than 7 hours	  5%

A total of 6 students reported they worked on the take-home exam for 5 hours or longer. So 6/0.15 = 40 is the total 
number of students who reported their time and 40*0.55 = 22 students spent fewer than 3 hours completing the take-home
exam. If the professor wanted to report the center of this distribution, the measure of center should she use is the
median, since it is right-skewed. And Bin "At least 4 hours, but less than 5 hours" includes the value of Q3 (75%)'
