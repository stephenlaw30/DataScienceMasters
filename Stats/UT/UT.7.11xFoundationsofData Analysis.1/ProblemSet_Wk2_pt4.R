'Suppose that hours of sleep per night for single adults between 30-40 years of age are normally distributed with a 
mean of 6.7 hours and a standard deviation of 1.1 hours.  

If an adult has a z-score of -1.5, this person gets -1.5 = (x - 6.7) / 1.1 hours of sleep per night.'
(-1.5*1.1) + 6.7 = #5.05 hours of sleep per night

(4.5 - 6.7) / 1.1 
1-pnorm(-2) = #0.9772499 

'0.977 = 97.7% of adults sleep longer than 4.5 hours per night.'

(5.38 - 6.7) / 1.1 
(8.79 - 6.7) / 1.1 
1-pnorm(-1.2) = #0.8849303 
1-pnorm(1.9) = #0.02871656
0.8849303 - 0.02871656 #= 0.8562137
 What proportion of adults sleep between 5.38 and 8.79 hours of sleep? (Report to 3 decimal places.)
