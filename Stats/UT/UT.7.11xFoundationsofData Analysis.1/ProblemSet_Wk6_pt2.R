'Problem Set 6.2: CDC Flu

Records at the Center for Disease Control show that the total number of flu cases in Spring, 2009 looked like this:

Date	  Day	  Flu Cases
April 27	0	  73
April 28	1	  105
April 29	2	  137
April 30	3	  257
May 1 	  4	  367
May 2	    5	  658
May 3 	  6	  898
May 4	    7	  1,085
May 5	    8 	1,490
May 6	    9 	1,893

An initial examination of the data showed that both an exponential and a logistic growth model fit the data well:

Exponential Model	  Logistic Growth Model
a = 76.64	          C = 3,273.31
b = 1.46	          a = 43.59
R-squared = 0.984	  b = 1.57
    	              R-squared = 0.996

Looking at the raw data, the rate of change in flu cases from April 30 to May 1 was 0.43. The growth rate for the
flu, according to the exponential model was 0.46. The predicted number of cases of flu on Day 14 using the 
exponential model is 76.64*(1.46)^1 = 15324.82 Using the logistic model, the predicted number of flu cases on Day 14
is 3273.31 / (1 + 43.59*(1.57)^-14) = 3034.078. The actual number of flu cases on Day 14 was 4,379. 
The residual of the exponential model prediction is 4379 - 15325 = -10946 and the residual of the logistic model 
prediction for Day 14 is 4379 - 3034 = 1345.

The better fit statistic of the logistic model suggests that the number of new flu cases will taper off. Based on
this model, we would expect the maximum number of flu cases in the 2009 season to be 3273. However, neither model 
does a perfect job of predicting future cases by Day 14. We will need to observe how the data changes after day 9 
to determine how the model needs to be adjusted.'
