  * Numerical variables = quantitative = sensible to add/subtract, take averages, etc.\
    * continous --> infinite # of values w/in given range (height, weight)
      * rounding of continous can make a variable look discrete
    * discrete --> one of a specific set of numeric values, so we can account for/enumerate/count all 
        the numeric possibilites (# of cars in lot) = COUNTS
  * Categorical variables = qualitative = limited # of distinct categories, which can be IDed w/ #s but are not 
    sensible to do operations on (1 = male, 2 = female)
    * ordinal - levels w/ inherent ordering (not satisfied, satisfied, very satisfied)
    * regular categorical - levels w/ NO inherent ordering (morning person, afternoon person, night owl)

Studies
  * observational --> collect data in a way that does not directly interfere w/ how data arises ("observe")
    * can ONLY establish ASSOCIATION/CORRELATION between explanatory/dependent vars and indepenent/response vars
    * RETROSPECTIVE --> data from past
    * PROSPECTIVE --> data collected as study goes on to predict future
  * experiment -->  random assign subjects to treatments to assign causal connections between vars

CONFOUNDING VARIABLES - extraneous variables affecting both explanatory/dep and response/ind vars to make it seem 
  like there is some relationship between them
