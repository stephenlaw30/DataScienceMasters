SD of % living in poverty = 3.1% + of % of high school graduates = 3.73% in our data set. Given that the correlation between these variables = -.75, what is the slope of the regression line for predicting % living in poverty from % of high school graduates? 

```{r}
sd.pov <- 3.1
sd.hs <- 3.73
R <- -.75
(slope <- (sd.pov/sd.hs)*R)
```

Given the average % living in poverty = 11.35% + average % of HS grads = 86.01%, what is the intercept of the regression line for predicting % living in poverty from % of high school graduates? 

```{r}
pov_bar <- 11.35
hs_bar <- 86.01
(int <- pov_bar - slope*hs_bar)
```
