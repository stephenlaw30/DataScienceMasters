# Ticket Sales

```{r}
sales <- read.csv("sales.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)
# View dimensions of sales
dim(sales)

# Inspect first 6 rows of sales
head(sales)

# View column names of sales
names(sales)
```

 rows appear to represent individual purchases and the columns contain different pieces of information about each purchase. 
 
```{r}
 # Look at structure of sales
str(sales)

# View a summary of sales
summary(sales)

# Load dplyr
library(dplyr)

# Get a glimpse of sales
glimpse(sales)

# Remove the first column (just a duplication of the row numbers)  of sales: sales2
sales2 <- sales[,-1]
```
