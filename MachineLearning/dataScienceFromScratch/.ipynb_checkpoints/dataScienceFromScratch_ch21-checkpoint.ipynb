    "\n",
    "An alternative metric = **betweenness centrality** = ID's people who frequently are on the shortest paths between pairs of other people. In particular, the betweenness centrality of node `i` = adding up, for every other pair of nodes `j` and `k`, the proportion of shortest paths between node `j` and node `k` that pass through `i`.\n",

    "3. Maintain a dictionary `shortest_paths_to` where keys = user IDs + values = lists of paths that end at the user w/ the specified ID. If there is a unique shortest path, list will just contain that 1 path. If there are multiple shortest paths, list will contain all of them.\n",
    "4. Also maintain a queue `frontier` that contains the users we want to explore in the order we want to explore them, stored as pairs `(prev_user, user)` so we know how we got to each one. \n",
    "5. Initialize the queue w/ all neighbors of `from_user` (**queues** = data structures optimized for “add to the end” + “remove from the front” operations that, in Python, are implemented as **collections.deque**, which is actually a double-ended queue)\n",
    "6. Explore the graph, + whenever we find new neighbors we don’t already know shortest paths to, add them to the end of the queue to explore later, w/  current user as `prev_user`.\n",
    "7. When we take a user off the queue + we’ve never encountered that user before, we’ve definitely found 1+ shortest paths to him — each of the shortest paths to `prev_user` w/ 1 extra step added.\n",
