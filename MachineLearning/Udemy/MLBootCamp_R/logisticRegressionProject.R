In this project we will be working with the **UCI adult dataset**, attempting to predict if people in data set belong in a certain `class` by `salary`, either making less than or equal to \$50k or more $50k per year.
Typically most of your time is spent cleaning data, not running the few lines of code that build your model, this project will try to reflect that by showing different issues that may arise when cleaning data.
