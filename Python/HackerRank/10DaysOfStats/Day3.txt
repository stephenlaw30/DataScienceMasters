Suppose a family has  children, one of which is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?

- sample space = BB, BG, GB, GG --> cannot be GG --> BB, BG, GB --> 1/3

You draw 2 cards from a standard 52-card deck without replacing them. What is the probability that both cards are of the same suit?

= P(HH) + P(SS) + P(CC) + P(DD)
= 4*(13/52*12/51) = 12/51

A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement. 
If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?

= P(B|A)) = P(A and B)/P(A) --> P(B|R) = P(R and B)/P(R) = ((3/7)*(4/6))/(3/7) = 2/3
