Task 
In a single toss of  fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that their sum will be at most 9.

# of unfavorable outcomes = 6
	- 4+6
	- 6+4
	- 5+5
	- 5+6
	- 6+5
	- 6+6
		

# of outcomes
	- (6 outcomes for 1st die)*(6 outcomes for 2nd die) = 36 outcomes
	
P = favorable outcomes/total outcomes = 30 / 36 = 5/6
	
	
In a single toss of  fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and the two dice have a sum of 6.

# of favorable outcomes
	- 5+1
	- 1+5
	- 2+4
	- 4+2

# of outcomes
	- (6 outcomes for 1st die)*(6 outcomes for 2nd die) = 36 outcomes
	
P = favorable outcomes/total outcomes = 4 / 36 = 1/9

There are 3 urns labeled X, Y, and Z. 

Urn X contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls.
Urn Y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.
Urn Z contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls. 

One ball is drawn from each of the 3 urns. What is the probability that, of the 3 balls drawn, 2 are red and 1 is black?

- the probability of the union of disjoint events each formed from the intersection of independent events.

- Add up the probabilities of all mutually exclusive cases	
	= RRB + RBR + BRR
	= (4/7)*(5/9)*(1/2) + (4/7)*(4/9)*(1/2) + (3/7)*(5/9)*(1/2)
